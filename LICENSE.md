# Black Circuit Source License (BCSL) v0.1 — Draft

Copyright (c) Black Circuit

## 1. Purpose and Intent

The Black Circuit Source License (“BCSL”) governs software, infrastructure, documentation, and related materials released by the Black Circuit project.
This license reflects a forward-looking model in which components may transition toward broader open collaboration over time while maintaining clear authorship, stewardship, and architectural integrity.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise in a repository or release artifact, all rights remain reserved by the copyright holder.

## 2. Definitions

**“Work”** means the software, configuration, documentation, or other materials distributed under this License.

**“Black Circuit Maintainers”** refers to the original authors or designated project stewards responsible for governance decisions.

**“Approved Distribution”** refers to any publication channel formally designated by the Maintainers, including but not limited to Aetheric Forge.

**“Derivative Works”** means modifications, extensions, or adaptations based on the Work.

## 3. Grant of Rights

Subject to the terms below, recipients are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to:

* Access and review the Work for evaluation, research, and internal development purposes.
* Execute the Work within private environments.
* Propose improvements or patches through channels approved by the Maintainers.

No rights are granted to publicly redistribute, sublicense, or commercially exploit the Work unless explicitly authorized in writing by the Maintainers.

## 4. Redistribution and Publication

1. Public distribution of the Work, in whole or in part, is prohibited unless:

   * The Work has been released through an Approved Distribution; and
   * The release explicitly states that redistribution is permitted.

2. Mirroring repositories, publishing modified versions, or repackaging the Work under a different project name without authorization is not allowed.

3. Portions of the Work designated for open collaboration may be relicensed independently at the discretion of the Maintainers.

## 5. Contributions

Any contributions submitted to the project are understood to be offered under the terms of this License unless another agreement is provided in writing.

By contributing, you affirm that:

* You have the legal right to submit the contribution.
* The contribution does not knowingly violate intellectual property rights of others.

The Maintainers reserve the right to modify, integrate, or decline contributions at their sole discretion.

## 6. Attribution

Where attribution is required, references to “Black Circuit” and the original authors must be preserved in source headers, documentation, and release notes.

Removal or alteration of authorship notices without authorization is prohibited.

## 7. Transition to Open Source

The Maintainers may, at any time and without prior notice, designate specific components as open source and release them under a separate license.

Such re-licensing does not retroactively alter the terms applied to prior versions unless explicitly stated.

## 8. Warranty Disclaimer

THE WORK IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Use of the Work is at your own risk.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the Work or from interactions with the Work.

## 10. Governing Intent

This License is intended to express the governance and distribution model of the Black Circuit ecosystem.
If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in effect to the fullest extent permitted.
