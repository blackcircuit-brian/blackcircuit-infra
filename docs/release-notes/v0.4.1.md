# v0.4.1

Release type: Patch  
Branch: v0.4

## Summary

v0.4.1 moves MetalLB runtime configuration (IPAddressPool and L2Advertisement)
under GitOps management while retaining bootstrap ownership of the controller
and CRDs.

No ingress components were introduced in this release.

## Changes

- Added `metallb-pools` application to providers ApplicationSet.
- MetalLB pools now reconciled declaratively via Argo CD.
- No change to bootstrap installation semantics.
- Corrected intermediate ApplicationSet structural issue.

## Non-Changes

- No ingress-nginx changes
- No cert-manager changes
- No DNS behavior changes
- No CRD lifecycle changes

## Rationale

Separates controller lifecycle (bootstrap-owned) from runtime configuration
(GitOps-owned) to improve reproducibility and reduce configuration drift.
